      "The agent informs the customer they will receive a callback to confirm resolution of the issue.",
      "The agent asks if the customer needs anything else, and the customer says no.",
      "The agent thanks the customer for calling and informs them they will receive a feedback survey about the call.",
      "The agent wishes the customer a nice day to end the call.",
      "Overall, it appears to be a standard customer service interaction where the agent assists the customer with an issue."
    ],
    "remarks": [
      "The agent uses polite and formal language by addressing the customer as maam repeatedly. This shows respect.",

      "The agent seems attentive by acknowledging the customer's responses with Yeah, Right, etc. ",

      "There are a couple instances where the agent apologizes for misspellings or having to call the customer back, demonstrating good customer service.",

      "The agent verifies details like the customer's issue being resolved, demonstrating care and attentiveness.",
      "The agent informs the customer that they will receive feedback forms, likely to allow the company to monitor service quality.",
      "There are some filler words like I mean ,Okay, etc. that could be reduced with more practice/training.",
      "Overall the agent comes across as polite, attentive, and aiming to provide good customer service. There are opportunities to improve with more training and practice."
    ],

    "resolution": "The transcript depicts a customer service call between an agent and a customer (ma'am). The agent is confirming details about the customer's issue, which seems to have been resolved. The agent asks for clarification on the spelling of something and apologizes for the inconvenience. The agent informs the customer that she may need to call back to confirm, and that the call is being recorded for quality assurance purposes. The agent verifies there is nothing else they can help with, thanks the customer for calling, and wishes her a nice day.In summary, this appears to be a routine customer service call where the agent is courteous, confirms details about the customer's resolved issue, and informs the customer the call is being recorded for quality assurance.The overall resolution seems to be that the customer's original issue was addressed and no further action is required.",

    "issue": [
      "There are several spelling and grammar errors, such as maam spelled incorrectly as maam, and sentences that are fragmented or run-on. This suggests the speaker is not proficient in English.",
      "There seems to be some confusion or lack of clarity around the customer's issue. The assistant asks if the issue is resolved, but it's not clear if it actually was.",
      "The conversation flows awkwardly, with the assistant repeatedly saying Okay, maam and Thank you, maam without natural pauses. This makes the dialogue sound robotic rather than natural.",
      "Toward the end, the assistant mentions sending feedback via WhatsApp, email and an app, but it's unclear if the customer agreed to receive feedback in all those places. Sending unsolicited feedback across multiple channels could be seen as spammy.",
      "Overall, the transcript suggests suboptimal customer service due to the errors, lack of clarity, unnatural dialogue flow, and potential spamming with unsolicited feedback. Improving the assistant's English proficiency, communication skills, and customer service training could help address these issues."
